## Validator Testing

### JSX

I have used jsx-Prettier and ESLint throughout the development to check that my JSX and JavaScript meet the standards for clean code.

### HTML

I validated my HTML pages using the W3 Nu HTML Checker. They came back with no errors, only pointers about redundant trailing slashes left by React. Please check the results for each page below.

<details>
<summary>HTML validation results</summary>

### CSS

Validation process was automated by using the 'CSS-validator npm package'. All pages come back clean without any errors. </br>

Vendor extensions are CSS properties or pseudo-elements specific to particular browser engines, prefixed with -webkit-, -moz-, etc. Pseudo-elements allow styling of parts of an element, such as scrollbars. In index.css, vendor extensions include -apple-system, -webkit-font-smoothing, and -moz-osx-font-smoothing. In App.module.css, vendor-specific pseudo-elements include ::-webkit-scrollbar, ::-webkit-scrollbar-track, and ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb.

Our project includes a CSS validation script `validate-css.js` that ensures all stylesheets adhere to web standards. This script uses the [W3C CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) to check for errors and warnings in our CSS files. Vendor-specific properties and pseudo-elements are flagged as warnings, which are expected. The validation process helps maintain clean, error-free CSS, enhancing cross-browser compatibility and overall code quality. To run the validation, use the command npm run validate:css.

### Python

<details>
<summary>PEP8</summary>
<br>

All Python files were run validated with pep8 and cleaned until no errors were found.

![pep8](/documentation/testing_image/validate_python.png)

</details>

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse to test all pages. Performance results were quite low, but this is to be expected when loading multiple images from an API, and sending lots of requests to another API. All other scores are good.

### Wave

<details>
<summary>Wave issues and solutions</summary>
<br>
By solving these issues, Wave reports no Error and no Contrast Errors.

![Wave](/documentation/testing_image/validate_wave.png)

- Contrast issue in 'comments' for the timestamp: I changed the color from #BC9BBB to a slightly darker hue, #966496.
- Error'''''''''''. Missing form label. A form control does not have a corresponding label: <br>
  This was solved by adding a form label for <Form.Control> in both CommentCreateForm.ja and CommentEditForm.js. <br>
  ` <Form.Label htmlFor="commentContent" className="sr-only">` <br>
  and <br>
  `<Form.Label htmlFor="editCommentContent" className="sr-only">`

- Error: Empty Link. A link contains no text: <br>
  Added 'aria-label' to links in Post.js

```
{likes_count}
<Link to={`/posts/${id}`} aria-label="View comments count">
  <i className="far fa-comments" aria-hidden="true" /> {comments_count}
</Link>
```

- Error: Missing alternative text for the avatar image: <br>
  Added the alt attribute to the <img> tag in ProfilePage.js. The alt attribute provides alternative text for screen readers, making the image accessible. <br>

```
<Col lg={3} className="text-lg-left">
  <Image
    className={styles.ProfileImage}
    roundedCircle
    src={profile?.image}
    alt={`${profile?.owner}'s profile image`}
  />
</Col>
```

- Error: Missing form label in PostsPage.js. A form control does not have a corresponding label: <br>
  This was solved by adding a form label for search input.

```
<Form.Group controlId="searchPosts">
  <Form.Label className="sr-only">Search Posts</Form.Label>
  <Form.Control
    id="searchPosts"
    value={query}
    onChange={(event) => setQuery(event.target.value)}
    type="text"
    className="mr-sm-2"
    placeholder="Search posts"
  />
</Form.Group>
```

### Custom Automated Testing

In addition to the various validators and automated tests above, I created some automated tests to test my code. Most of these tests check models, serializers, and validators used on the backend.

<details>
<summary>Preparation and setup for automatic test in API</summary>

#### Test case naming convention

'xxx-m/a-nn'

- xxx = Area of test
- m/a = manual or automatic script
- nn = test case IS no.

#### App abbreviation

- BLK = blocks
- CAT = category
- CMT = comments
- CON = contacts
- FOL = followers
- HME = Home
- LKE = likes
- NAV = Navigation
- POP = Popular profile
- PPM = PostCreate & PostEditForm
- PST = posts
- PRF = profiles
- SIU = SignIn&SignUP



#### Preparation and setup

**setUp Method**:

- This method is called before each individual test method to set up the necessary state.
- It creates a user with the username 'adam' and the password 'pass'.
- Logs in the created user.
- Creates a post associated with the logged-in user.
- Prepares the initial test environment.

**tearDown Method**:

- This method is called after each test method to clean up the test environment.
- Logs out the user.
- Deletes all User and Post instances to ensure a clean state for the next test.

## Issues

<details>
<summary>List of open and closed issues</summary>
<br>

**Known and unsolved issues**

  - Hashtag Error [BUG#68](https://github.com/JaqiKal/pixavibe-frontend/issues/68): The errors indicate that the response data does not contain the expected 'hashtag_ids' field. Instead, the response contains an empty 'hashtags' array. This suggests that the hashtags are not being properly associated with the post. Troubleshooting activities have been undertaken, also by senior developers (tutor support) but solution has not been found yet. The feature has been moved to the BUG lane on the Kanban board and will be revisited in future improvements of the Pixavibe app. To maintain a smooth user experience, the hashtag feature is retained in the codebase, but the multi-select form has been removed from the PostCreateForm and PostEditForm
  - When loading certain pages, 401/400 errors occur due to the absence or expiration of an authorization token, or when invalid form input is provided. These instances include:

    - Mounting when not logged in
    - Redirecting a logged-in user away from the sign-up/sign-in page
    - Submitting a sign-in form without entering a username. Expired access token that is refreshed in the background, leading to eventual success

      ![x](/documentation/testing_image/401-error.png)

  - Interface elements that depend on the user's authorization state sometimes fail to load without a page refresh. This behavior is consistent with the course material.
  - (posts/views.py): django rest framework bug, in the Filter set fields list the Field filters label shows 'Invalid Name'.

- **Solved Issues**

  - Social Authentication Installation Error:

    - During the process of setting up our Django application in the pixavibe-api environment, we encountered a specific error related to package dependencies when attempting to install `dj-rest-auth[with_social]`. This issue was triggered by an incompatibility between the django-allauth package and the version of Python we were using (Python 3.12.2).
      - Downgraded to Python 3.11.9 to resolve this.
      - Added runtime.txt with python-3.9.11 to ensure consistent Python version across environments and prevent future issues.
        To execute the final migration required for enabling JSON Web Token authentication.
      - pip install django-allauth==0.54.0
      - In settings.py MIDDLEWARE remove 'allauth.account.middleware.AccountMiddleware' this is only required since django-allauth==0.56.0
